class DepthwiseSeparableConvModule(nn.Module):
    """Depthwise separable convolution module.

    See https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04861.pdf for details.

    This module can replace a ConvModule with the conv block replaced by two
    conv block: depthwise conv block and pointwise conv block. The depthwise
    conv block contains depthwise-conv/norm/activation layers. The pointwise
    conv block contains pointwise-conv/norm/activation layers. It should be
    noted that there will be norm/activation layer in the depthwise conv block
    if `norm_cfg` and `act_cfg` are specified.

    Args:
        in_channels (int): Number of channels in the input feature map.
            Same as that in ``nn._ConvNd``.
        out_channels (int): Number of channels produced by the convolution.
            Same as that in ``nn._ConvNd``.
        kernel_size (int | tuple[int]): Size of the convolving kernel.
            Same as that in ``nn._ConvNd``.
        stride (int | tuple[int]): Stride of the convolution.
            Same as that in ``nn._ConvNd``. Default: 1.
        padding (int | tuple[int]): Zero-padding added to both sides of
            the input. Same as that in ``nn._ConvNd``. Default: 0.
        dilation (int | tuple[int]): Spacing between kernel elements.
            Same as that in ``nn._ConvNd``. Default: 1.
        norm_cfg (dict): Default norm config for both depthwise ConvModule and
            pointwise ConvModule. Default: None.
        act_cfg (dict): Default activation config for both depthwise ConvModule
            and pointwise ConvModule. Default: dict(type='ReLU').
        dw_norm_cfg (dict): Norm config of depthwise ConvModule. If it is
            'default', it will be the same as `norm_cfg`. Default: 'default'.
        dw_act_cfg (dict): Activation config of depthwise ConvModule. If it is
            'default', it will be the same as `act_cfg`. Default: 'default'.
        pw_norm_cfg (dict): Norm config of pointwise ConvModule. If it is
            'default', it will be the same as `norm_cfg`. Default: 'default'.
        pw_act_cfg (dict): Activation config of pointwise ConvModule. If it is
            'default', it will be the same as `act_cfg`. Default: 'default'.
        kwargs (optional): Other shared arguments for depthwise and pointwise
            ConvModule. See ConvModule for ref.
